# Resume Slide Deck — Wasim Akhtar

Create a polished, professional slide deck presentation showcasing the career and technical expertise of **Wasim Akhtar**, a Senior Technical Lead with 12+ years of experience in cloud-native development, DevOps, and enterprise software.

---

## Visual Style

- **Color palette:** Dark navy or charcoal background with white text and a bold accent color (electric blue or teal) for highlights, icons, and section dividers
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Montserrat, or Poppins). Large bold headlines, lighter weight body text
- **Icons:** Use flat, minimal tech icons (cloud, containers, code brackets, database) to represent skill categories — no clipart
- **Layout:** Modern, editorial-inspired. Use generous whitespace, asymmetric grids, and strong visual hierarchy
- **Imagery:** Abstract tech/data visuals or subtle gradient backgrounds — no stock photos of people

---

## Layout Approach

- Use asymmetrical, dynamic compositions with a tech-professional aesthetic
- Vary text placement from slide to slide for visual interest
- Layer icons, stat cards, and text in an editorial style
- Include whitespace strategically for sophistication and readability
- Mix large statement typography with smaller supporting text
- One key idea per slide — no walls of text

## Design Principles

- Every slide should communicate ONE key idea — no walls of text
- Use data visualization (timelines, stat cards, grids) instead of paragraphs
- Maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and color usage across all slides
- Keep bullet points to 3–5 per slide maximum
- Headlines should be punchy and benefit-oriented, not generic
- Maintain a cohesive visual identity while ensuring each slide feels fresh and engaging
